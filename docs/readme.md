# :school_satchel: Creating synthetic data in mule

## simple and plain

This is a toy project to provide an API that generates synthetic data, replicating the JSON request body of a POST. It is mostly intended as an exercise with two key areas of development:

* Developing with recursive functions in Dataweave
* Using a Java function from Dataweave

This page intends to walk through the process of developing this simple project. At the end of the document, we'll discuss potential options for adding functionality to this simple approach.

To facilitate the walk-through, I tried to create issues and commits for each individual step.
